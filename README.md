# Practical statistics: Udacity Project 3

Analyzing A/B TESTS

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. The aim of the project is to help understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website and to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
